# 2D Side-Scrolling Game
This project is a simple 2D side-scrolling game developed in Java as a personal programming exercise, serving as an introductory exploration of core game development and programming concepts.

The game features player movement, obstacles, and basic game logic commonly found in classic side-scrolling arcade games. Through this project, I practiced foundational programming concepts such as game loops, input handling, collision detection, and object-oriented design.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Navigate to the project directory  
3. Run the main game file ("FSE.java") from the "src" folder using the appropriate Java compiler  

## Assets and Credits
Sprites and images used in this project were sourced from publicly available asset libraries and are used for educational and non-commercial purposes only. All game logic and code were written by me.
